# Re: Research

A publication template with reproducible research in mind.

---

Every part in your analysis which is based upon
your data (e.g. figures, tables, numbers, variables) is inserted and
updated automatically in your article by your code.

This template focuses on the interaction between ```python``` and ```LaTeX```. It contains
several convenience functions which update the numbers, figures, and tables in the main article when the raw data changes.

All functionality and scripts are outlined on the [help page](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxmahlke/re-research/main/template.html).
