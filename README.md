# Re: Research

A publication template with reproducible research in mind.

---

It's a simple idea: Every part in your analysis which is output from your code (e.g. figures, tables, numbers, variables) should also be inserted and updated in your article by your code.

This template focuses on the interaction between ```python``` and ```LaTeX```. It contains
several convenience functions which automatically update the numbers, figures, and tables in the main article when the raw data changes.

The bottom line is reproducible research: With the scripts published with the manuscript, even if the data is proprietary, your analysis can be retraced.

- Uniform figure look

- Uniform font between figures and text
